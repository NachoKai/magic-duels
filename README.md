* If you win, you will choose a spell which corresponds to the stance you selected. Your goal is to get your opponents stamina to 0 before your own stamina depletes.  
* Spells can have a couple different effects: direct damage or healing, a chance for damage or healing over time, or a chance for a stun.  
* A stunned character will still be able to choose a stance each turn they’re stunned. If a stuned character wins the turn simply ends, if the stunned character loses then the turn proceeds as normal with the opposing character choosing a spell.  
* When both characters choose the same stance the round will tie and both can be healed, damaged or nothing depending the action.
